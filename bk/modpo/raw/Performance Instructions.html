<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center">A Vocabulary
for Peter Innisfree Moore</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center">(February
1974-July 1975)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">I. Description</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">A Vocabulary for Peter
Innisfree Moore is a 22" x 14" drawing and performance score comprising
960 hand-printed words-the largest number of words appearing on a single
surface in any of my Vocabularies. All of the words are spelled solely
with letters that appear in the dedicatee's name. No letter appears in
any single word more times than it does in the complete name. The words
were printed by hand in India ink on a white background with pens having
nibs of several different thicknesses, so that many sizes of letters
appear in the drawing. The words are oriented in many different
directions, their placements on the drawing and the directions in which
they read having been determined by chance operations. Reading all of the
words necessitates rotating the sheet of paper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">II. Compositional
Method</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">The Vocabulary was composed
in
several stages:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">1. It was conceived in a
general
way on 16-17 February 1974.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">2. The 960 words were
collected
as a list in a notebook, partly with the aid of dictionaries, 17
November-20
December 1974.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">3. The method of drawing
was
worked out on 20 December 1974. It comprised the following stages:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="a">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">The sheet of paper was divided into ten equal-sized
sectors: two horizontal rows of five sectors each.</li>
</ol>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="b">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">A directional diagram was drawn: a circle with ten
equally spaced radii, numbered from 0 to 9.</li>
</ol>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="c">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">Five random digits were used to select and place each
word: three drew the word from the list; one determined the sector in
which
it was to be hand printed; and one, following the circular diagram,
determined the direction in which the word should read. If a word couldn't
fit entirely in the chance-determined sector, it had to begin in that
sector
and end in a neighboring one.</li>
</ol>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="d">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">Pen nibs were first chosen by "impulse chance," but
as
the paper became filled up, only the smaller nibs could be used.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">4. The Vocabulary was
executed, following the above method, largely from 20 December 1974 to
sometime in February 1975, and completed on 9 July 1975.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">5. The performance method
was composed, though not described in the present form (the earlier
description appears on the backs of the photo-offset copies of its first
edition), 3-10 July 1975.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">The Vocabulary was first
performed, at the Studio for Creative Movement in New York City, by Neil
Elliott, Spencer Hoist, Jill Kroesen, Marcia Lind, Jackson Mac Low,
Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, Sharon Mattlin, Leonard Neufeld, Beate Wheeler,
and other speakers and musicians, 11 July 1975.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">III. Performance
Method</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">Performers: The Vocabulary
may be performed by any number of people, each of whom may speak, sing,
and/or play a musical instrument producing all twelve tones of the
chromatic scale in one or more registers. (The instruments may be tuned
in either equal or just temperament, but all instruments in a performance
should be tuned according to the same system, and singers should only
produce pitches playable by instruments tuned according to that
system.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(1) Speakers must have
clear diction and be able to project their voices, when necessary, without
shouting or straining or sounding "dramatic." Their speech should always
be
intelligible, whether they are speaking softly, moderately, or relatively
loudly, and they should often fall silent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(2) Singers must be able
to produce precisely all of the twelve tones within their vocal ranges,
to achieve a variety of timbres, attacks, amplitudes, durations (both of
sounds and silences), and rhythms, and to articulate the words they sing
intelligibly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(3) Instrumentalists must
also be able to produce precisely all the tones within their instruments'
ranges and achieve a variety of timbres, attacks, amplitudes, durations
(both of sounds and silences), and rhythms.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(4) All Performers must be
able and willing continually to listen with complete concentration and to
modify their actions, sounds, and silences in accordance with the changes
in the aural situation. All should often listen silently and only add new
sonic elements when they feel the latter may add positively to the aural
plenum. (Notions of what is "positive" will of course differ from
individual
to individual.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">Procedure: Each performer
moves the eyes freely from any word to any other word, first looking at
the entire word field, any side up, and then choosing a word or string of
words to speak, sing, and/or play as a sequence of instrumental tones
and/or one or more chords or other aggregates. Then the performer listens
attentively, observing silence for a short, moderately long, or even very
long time, eventually choosing another word or string from the field and
realizing it as speech, song, and/or instrumental sound. Performers must
partially rotate the score from time to time in order to bring as many
words as possible into clear, readable view during the course of the
performance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(1) When speaking
performers say words singly or concatenated into strings: phrases,
clauses, other sentence fragments, complete sentences, or nonnormative
word strings. Any word or string or any series of words and/or strings
may be repeated any number of times. (Because their execution may involve
moving the eyes from word to word in circles or other closed curves, such
repetitions are often called "loops.") Performers should vary their
loudness and reading tempo in accord with their perception of the total
aural situation, but none should try to predominate over other performers
or otherwise call special attention to themselves by "overexpressive" or
"dramatic" delivery. Only complete words should be spoken: words should
not be broken into syllables or phonemes, and no syllable or phoneme
should be spoken separately from the word of which it is a segment.
Speakers may fall silent at any time and may remain silent until they
feel ready-as a result of concentrated listening and general perceptual
attention-to add new words or strings to the total performance situation
as they perceive it. Speakers should not sing words unless they are
prepared to produce accurately tones corresponding to the words' letter
sequences, as described below.



</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(2) When singing performers
may either:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="a">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">vocalize a tone sequence corresponding to a chosen
word's letter sequence, using vowel sounds or liquids-preferably ones
occurring in the chosen word-or</li>
</ol>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="b">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">sing the word itself, using all of a tone sequence
(translating a letter sequence) by allotting two or more tones to each
syllable of the word.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(3) When either singing
or playing instruments performers translate successive letters of the
words
into
tones of the following specific pitch classes (in any register [s]):</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">E = E natural<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>O = G flat/F sharp</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">F = F natural<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>P = B natural</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">I = D flat/C sharp<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>R = A flat/G sharp</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">M = G natural<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>S = E flat/D sharp</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">N = C natural<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>T = D natural</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">89</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(4) Both instrumentalists
and singers may play and/or sing either sequences or aggregates of
pitches corresponding to the sequences of letters in Vocabulary
words.</p>

ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a&gt;
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">Sequences may be melodies, widely separated tones,
broken chords, or any other pitch sequences as well as ones combining
various possibilities.</li>


ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=b&gt;
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">Aggregates are produced by sounding simultaneously
two
or more tones corresponding to adjacent letters in a word. They may be
intervals, chords (including chords produced by sustaining the tones of a
broken chord, e.g., by means of the piano's "loud" pedal), or tone
clusters
(including clusters produced by sustaining a nonchordal sequence of
tones).
Any word's tone sequence may be rendered as a series of aggregates (or of
aggregates and single tones) and series of two or more aggregates and/or
tones may be sustained to produce larger aggregates.</li>


ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=b&gt;
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in">Any sequence or aggregate may be repeated any number
of
times.</li>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">Register (Octave Placement)
of each of the tones in sequences or aggregates must be carefully chosen
by each performer, keeping in mind the effective range and capabilities
of the performer's particular voice or instrument. There are at least
eight types of octave placement:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(1) The uniqueness of a
word's tone sequence may be rendered clearly perceptible in a pitch
sequence or aggregate by Upward Placement: playing or singing each
successive tone after the first (in the tone sequence) at a pitch higher
than that of the one preceding it and going up into a higher octave
whenever necessary. (Complete upward placement will often, of course, not
be possible, due to the limits of the ranges of particular voices or
instruments.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(2) In Close Placement all
the tones of a sequence are placed within an octave or so, and all
intervals, including major and minor seconds, are allowed. A tone may be
played more than once at the same actual pitch, and the direction of a
pitch sequence may be changed one or more times.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(3) In Wide Placement
major and minor seconds are avoided, thirds seldom occur, and usually no
tone is placed more than once in the same octave.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(4) In One-Directional
Placement upward or downward, each successive tone, whether in a melody
or other sequence or in a chord or other aggregate, is placed higher (or
lower) than the one preceding it in the tone (corresponding to a letter)
sequence, so that the latter occurs vertically as well as
horizontally.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(5) Upward Wide
(One-Dimensional)
Placement is highly recommended for instruments or voices with large
ranges, especially pianos, harps, and other instruments having pedals
that allow a sequence of tones produced separately to be held as a chord
or other aggregate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(6) In Changing Placement
the direction of the tones in a sequence changes from time to time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(7) In Chaotic Placement
the
direction changes at each successive tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(8) In Chaotic Very Wide
Placement large leaps, sometimes of several octaves, occur between tones,
and the direction of each leap is different.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(9) Musicians will
probably discover and distinguish still other types of placement than the
above, and various types may be combined within sequences, e.g., a
sequence
begun
in Close Upward Placement might end in Chaotic Very Wide Placement.
Making and observing these distinctions will allow musicians to make
informed conscious choices in placing tones as well as in selecting words
to "translate" into tone sequences and/or aggregates. One's instrument's
or voice's capabilities as well as one's musical and other abilities and
spontaneous or considered response to the immediate performance situation
will help determine which placements are best at different moments in a
performance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">Amplitudes (Loudness): All
performers choose amplitudes in relation to the total aural situation.
However:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(1) Voices should usually
keep to amplitudes ranging from mp (moderately soft) to f (loud), with
only occasional ff (very loud), p (soft), or pp (very soft) sounds. (While
variety is desirable, intelligibility is imperative.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(2) Instruments should
usually keep to amplitudes ranging from ppp (very very soft) to
mf (moderately loud), with only occasional f (loud) or ff (very loud)
sounds, and still fewer fff (very very loud) sounds. (Instruments should
seldom if ever drown out the voices or lessen the intelligibility of
words.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">Performance Duration: A
performance of the Vocabulary may be of any duration, but one lasting
less than ten minutes will allow the realization of very few of the
possibilities offered by the large number of words and their
corresponding tone sequences. (Marathon performances lasting several
hours or even several days are possible.) The duration of a performance
may be determined in one of the following ways:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(1) An open consensus
process may be worked out by the performers, through which they decide
among themselves, during performance, when to stop. This is the most
flexible and democratic method of deciding performance duration and most
accords with the spirit of the piece. (A clock visible to all performers
is desirable if other works-and especially works by others-are to be
performed on the same program.)



</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(2) The duration may be
preset the
beginning and the end being signaled by a time keeper-usually one of the
speakers, singers, and/or instrumentalists, but not necessarily-chosen by
the members of the performance group.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">(3) The performers may
select one among them to act as a leader who will signal the beginning
and decide during a performance when to end it. This "leader" need not be
much more than a modestly glorified timekeeper who decides, around the
time when the performance should end anyway, given its context and
circumstances, that some particular point is a good place to stop. (A
clock or watch should be visible to the leader.) However, the members of
the performance group may choose to give the leader greater latitude
than this in determining the duration of a performance, so that the
leader's decision may significantly affect the performance's duration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">General Considerations
("style," "attitude," etc.): Since not only choices of words from the
Vocabulary thus, too, for singers and instrumentalists, choices of tone
sequences and aggregates-but also those within all other parameters are
made by the performers at their own discretion, they must each exercise
great care, tact, courtesy, attention, and concentration to make every
detail of their performances contribute (as far as they can ascertain
from where they are) toward a global sound sequence and aural plenum
(including ambient, audience, and outer-environmental sounds) each of
them would choose to hear. "Ego-tripping" without regard to what else is
happening is the worst of "wrong notes" in performing this piece.
However, the exercise of virtuosity is strongly encouraged when it is
done with as much consciousness as possible of its place in the total
sound, especially its relation to the contributions of the other
performers. In short, performers must be both inventive and sensitive to
other persons and sounds at all times.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">Preperformance Work: While
spontaneity in performances is generally very desirable, the large number
of words (and corresponding tone sequences) in the Vocabulary makes it
also desirable that those performers who wish to do so should work out
certain ways of speaking, singing, and/or playing some of the words and
tone sequences and of bringing these previously worked out procedures
into the performance from time to time, along with other procedures
arrived at more spontaneously during the performance. For instance,
speakers may wish to construct certain sentences or other word strings;
singers and instrumentalists may wish to compose melodies, chords, or
other tone sequences and aggregates; and performers of all kinds may wish
to associate certain timbres, durations, rhythms, amplitudes, or ways of
repetition with some words, strings, sequences, or aggregates. Having a
repertoire of such procedures available may often add more (in richness
and multiplicity) than it detracts from spontaneity, especially since the
use of those procedures is subject to in-performance choices arising out
of the immediate situation, including choices to modify some of the
previously worked out procedures as the moment (and/or the performer's
reaction to it) demands.</p>
