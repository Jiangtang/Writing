Hi, ModPo people, this is Al and this is an introduction to week 2 — chapter 1 continued. And in the second half of chapter 1, instead of reading some more Dickinson and Whitman, we will be reading some Dickinsonians and Whitmanians. The Whitmanians are slightly more specifically identified with Whitman than the Dickinsonians with Dickinson, and that's perhaps because the Whitman style is more specific and more particular, its traits more easily identifiable at least. Although I hasten to note that in the case of William Carlos Williams, the one thing that does not come from Whitman would be the long line. Williams was a poet primarily of short lines, and in that sense, he follows the Dickinsonian influence into modernism of concision and pithiness. But Williams temperamentally, in terms of his conception of the genius of the poet, in terms of his egotism, and in other ways, has to be considered in some of his poems to be primarily a Whitmanian among the early modernists. And, of course, Allen Ginsberg got his Whitman through Williams as well as directly from Whitman. Among the Whitmanian poets we'll be reading — several by Williams — is "Danse Russe." And "Danse Russe" is a poem that plays off of — at least most critics think — the ballet Petrushka, which was debuted in France in 1911 at the Russian ballet in France by the legendary itinerant ballet company directed by famed impresario Sergei Diaghilev. This troop performed Petrushka and other so-called Russian ballets between the years 1909 and 1929. And I think it's generally agreed by critics that that is an influence on this poem by Williams. The original music for Petrushka was in fact composed by Stravinsky and if all that, in fact, is in the origin of this poem — it's not that important to finally decide this one way or the other — but if it is, then it's helpful to know the following: that Petrushka is based on a traditional Russian story of a puppet who comes to life. And although you won't find it specifically in the video discussion of this poem, referring to a puppet that comes to life, obviously this somewhat exhausted and perhaps bored suburban dad/husband/poet does come to life in his attic. It's a poem about remembering how wild you are, at least momentarily, in the suburbs.

And of course, we'll also encounter Allen Ginsberg's famous specific connection to Whitman in the poem "A Supermarket in California."

When we turn to the Dickinsonians, we'll be looking at several poems by a much-underrated poet. She's now more widely read then she was a couple of decades ago, but I'm really pleased that Lorine Niedecker is part of ModPo. She gets three poems, they're very short: "Grandfather Advised Me," "You Are My Friend," and a poem called "Foreclosure" which is a little more political in its edginess than the other two. By the way, Cid Corman, another poet we meet this week — himself, a bit of a recluse — traveled all the way from Japan to find Lorine Niedecker at her remote, rural Wisconsin home in the American Midwest, and brought his tape recorder, and on a day in 1970 recorded Lorine Niedecker reading "Foreclosure," and that's the recording we will hear here:

[audio of Lorine Niedecker performing "Foreclosure"]

Niedeckers' poems are in some ways classically Dickinsonian, and in other ways, well... in other ways, they are moving in many different directions all at once.

Cid Corman is not really a Dickinsonian poet, and I'm not sure that anybody has ever actually used the term "Dickinsonian" or even referred to Emily Dickinson in connection with Corman, but I think it makes sense, for this poem at least because of its intense self-referentiality. The poem "It Isn't For Want" is indeed a poem about poetry in a Dickinsonian way, with the Dickinsonian force and condensation. And because of Cid Corman's plea from within the words of the poem to exist, his plea to exist, to be in the poem and because of the words of the poem, a plea for us to read the poem and thus enable him to exist. Because of that, this poem has become somewhat anthemic for all of ModPo, a calling-out from the poetry to us to see reading and engaging with poetry as a vital activity, an activity for which there's actually quite a lot at stake. So that's Cid Corman.

[audio of Cid Corman performing "It Isn't For Want"]

And finally among the Dickinsonians, we look at Rae Armantrout, who is probably just as much Dickinsonian as Ginsberg is Whitmanian. This is where the Dickinson tradition holds specific sway. And we choose a poem called "The Way" by Rae Armantrout. She's doing a lot of other things that we will recognize when we get to chapter 9 and the so-called Language poets. But for now, it serves our purpose to understand her as bringing the Dickinsonian mode to postmodern poetry. And one of the things we ask you to do when we encounter a Rae Armantrout is to listen to a 25-minute discussion that I moderated for the PoemTalk series, the podcast series, on this particular poem. And we also make available to you a recording of Rae Armantrout being interviewed by Charles Bernstein, another chapter 9.1 poet, a Language poet, and also, by the way, co-director with me of the PennSound project here at the University of Pennsylvania. Yes, Charles Bernstein interviewing Armantrout, and he asks her about this poem, "The Way." So you not only have the benefit of the discussion in the video between and among the ModPo TAs and me, but you also have Armantrout talking about the poem and three poets meeting with me to talk about the same poem. So maybe this is overkill. Maybe you'll feel you've had plenty of "The Way" and of Armantrout, but I hope that you are intrigued by her. She's a remarkable poet. And I would urge you to go to your favorite search engine, Google or whatever, and type in "Armantrout Dickinson 9 poets" and if you search that, you'll come upon a link to recordings made in the year 2000 at an event that I hosted which featured nine contemporary poets reading themselves through — each one — through one modernist. And Rae Armantrout chose Emily Dickinson, although she's a pre-modernist or a proto-modernist. And in her 30-minute performance, after an introduction by me, Rae Armantrout talks about the importance of Dickinson to her.

Then she proceeds to read a few Dickinson poems and then she turns to some of her own poems. So if you're looking for more Rae Armantrout, that would be a great way to go. For those inclined to consult ModPo's extra supplemental syllabus ModPo Plus, you will find several more Armantrout poems and one short essay there in ModPo Plus as well as our discussions of these poems. So, again, if Armantrout's short, pithy, juxtapositional, difficult — supposedly difficult — poems intrigue you, there's plenty more to be found here in ModPo and elsewhere.

We hope you enjoy week 2 of chapter 1. And the purpose here again is obviously to enrich and deepen our sense of the importance of the proto-modernists, Whitman and Dickinson, as we go forward. And I should note something I already mentioned elsewhere, which is that the Whitmanian influence is both more specific and also carries somewhat less weight through the modernist period, through chapter 2 in particular. Although at the very end of the course, in the most contemporary recent poetry, Whitman makes quite a comeback. Dickinson, I would say, is an overall greater influence on poets like Stein and John Ashbery and the Language poets, in particular on Susan Howe. And so the Dickinsonian tradition is, well, something to maybe if not master, then to try to understand because it'll be very beneficial as we move through the course.

> Oh strong-ridged and deeply hollowed  
> nose of mine! what will you not be smelling?  
> What tactless asses we are, you and I, boney nose,  
> always indiscriminate, always unashamed,  
> and now it is the souring flowers of the bedraggled  
> poplars: a festering pulp on the wet earth  
> beneath them. With what deep thirst  
> we quicken our desires  
> to that rank odor of a passing springtime!  
> Can you not be decent? Can you not reserve your ardors  
> for something less unlovely? What girl will care  
> for us, do you think, if we continue in these ways? 
> Must you taste everything? Must you know everything? 
> Must you have a part in everything?
