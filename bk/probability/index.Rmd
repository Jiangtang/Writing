# Welcome {-}

This is my programming notes on probability, mostly based on the [*Introduction to Probability*][1] by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.

## Software Used: R/Python {-}

I use Rstudio/Notebooks for every single markdown page (in which R is the first-class language while Python is loosely supported ). Rstudio/Bookdown is used to manage all pages.  

For R:

```{r}
print(paste0("R Base: ",package_version(R.version)))
packinfo <- installed.packages(fields = c("Package", "Version"))
packinfo[c("rmarkdown","bookdown","knitr","prob"),c("Package", "Version")]
```

For Python:

```{python}
#python
import numpy
import scipy

print ("numpy",numpy.__version__)
print ("scipy",scipy.__version__)
```
